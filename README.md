#Even or Odd Game
##What is it?
A recreation of a simple Andoid app I liked and wanted to code myself

- A random number appears & the you must identify if it's Even or Odd. (It's really that simple)
- You get 10 seconds when the game starts to correctly identify as many as possible
- 10 Seconds is added to your Time Remaining after you get 10 in a row
- The game ends immediately when you guess wrong or run out of time

##How to Play/("Install")
**You will need Java to run the game:** [Download java](https://java.com/en/download/)

### **[Download Runnable JAR File Here](https://github.com/SleekPanther/even-odd-game/blob/master/EvenOdd.jar?raw=true)** ###
1. If that link does't work...
2. Locate `EvenOdd.jar` in the base folder of this repository
3. Click it (a blank preview will pop up. You can't actually see the contents since it's a binary file)
4. Click View Raw & the file should download
5. Double-click `EvenOdd.jar` to run the game

###Important Notes for High Scores###
- **When you download an updated version of the game, simply overwrite or delete the old `EvenOdd.jar` file**
- **Saving `EvenOdd.jar` in a new location will reset your high score**
- **Moving the existing `EvenOdd.jar` file will also reset your score**

###Zip Method###
1. **Download Zip** from this GitHub page (or clone the repository).
    * You really just need the `EvenOdd.jar` file but you can download all the files if you want
    * Click  **Clone or download**
    * **Download Zip** should be a a button on the far right below **1 Contributor** (next to **Clone in Desktop**, **Copy to Clipboard** and **HTTPS**)

    * You can use a  built-in operating system utility or software like [WinRar](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) or [7Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
    
3. Open the `even-odd-game-master` folder
